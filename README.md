# metaphor_api_python
python code for metaphor API project

How to run this script:

Put in two files for your API keys, my files were called openAI_API_Key.json and metaphor_API_key.json respectively, 
in these two files, put in your API keys in the following format:
{"API_Key":"PASTE_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"}

Run the file and put in any list of ingredients you want (can be long or short, i've tested this script many times and gives pretty great results)
Thank you Metaphor for the time and consideration!
